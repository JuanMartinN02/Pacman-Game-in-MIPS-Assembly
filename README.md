# Pacman Game in MIPS Assembly
Description:
This project is a Pacman game developed using MIPS assembly language, where memory is used to represent the game map. Coins and enemies are randomly generated, adding an element of unpredictability to the gameplay. The enemies move randomly as well, making the game both challenging and dynamic. This project demonstrates advanced use of memory management, random number generation, and logic control in assembly, creating a unique twist on a classic game.

Features:

Pacman game logic implemented in MIPS Assembly.
Randomly generated coins and enemies for increased replayability.
Enemies follow random movement patterns, enhancing the challenge.
Memory mapping to manage the game environment and interactions.
Technologies:
